  <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>

  <p>
    This is my first HTML webpage, built using only basic HTML elements.
    It shows how structure and content work together on the web.
  </p>

  <h2>About This Page</h2>

  <p>
    HTML is a markup language used to structure content.
    With headings, paragraphs, and images, we can create meaningful webpages.
  </p>

  <h3>Why I Am Learning HTML</h3>

  <p>
    Learning HTML is the foundation of web development.
    It allows me to understand how websites are built from scratch.
  </p>

  <p>
    This page is simple, valid, and ready to be styled later with CSS
    and enhanced with JavaScript.
